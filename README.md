# What is this?

A streaming async API to 4chan boards. You create a handler class, implement some callbacks and get informed when new
posts and images arrive in threads. There's a bundled `FileHandler` that saves content to the file system.

# How?

The bundled executable called `hurr-durr` is a scraper. You use it as

    hurr-durr --directory /tmp/4chan --board b

There's an optional `-i` flag to also download the images and a `-v` flag to see logging information. All this is also
available via the `-h` flag.

As for the API part, the main entry point is `hurr_durr.ChanWatcher`. You have to implement a handler class and then
do something along the lines of

```python
from hurr_durr import FileHandler, ChanWatcher

watcher = ChanWatcher(FileHandler('/tmp/4chan/b'), 'b', images=True)
watcher.start()
```

The only handler currently bundled is a `FileHandler` which saves content to disk. To implement your own handler,
you need to create a class containing 4 methods:

 * `post(thread_id, new_post)` -- gets called when a new post is made in a thread
 * `pruned(thread_id)` -- gets called when a thread is pruned from 4chan
 * `img(thread_id, filename, data)` -- gets called with downloaded image data, only relevant if images are downloaded
 * `download_img(thread_id, filename)` -- gets called to check if a particular image should be downloaded, only relevant
    if images are downloaded

# Installing

It's in PyPI, just use pip

    pip install hurr-durr

# Why?

Because I needed a 4chan scraper, everything else sucked, and I wanted to give Tornado a ride around the block.
